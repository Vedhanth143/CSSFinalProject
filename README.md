This project is a pure HTML-based website created as part of my learning journey at TAP Academy. 
It showcases the fundamentals of HTML through real-world sections and multiple mini-projects, all built without JavaScript frameworks.
The website highlights the importance of HTML in web development, introduces core concepts, and displays projects developed during the course under the guidance of Trainer Harshit Sir.
